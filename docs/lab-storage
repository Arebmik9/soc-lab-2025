### 🗄️  Lab Storage Location

| Item | Path |
|------|------|
| VirtualBox VMs | **E:\VMs** (external USB-SSD) |
| ISO library | **E:\ISOs** |
| Snapshots | Inside each VM folder on **E:\VMs** |

**Why external?**  
- Frees 60 + GB from the laptop’s NVMe drive  
- Allows quick transport between machines  
- Keeps lab disks physically separable from the host in case of malware tests

> *Note:* the external drive is formatted **exFAT** so both Windows and macOS can read it if I migrate the lab later.
